# MCMALA
Monte-Carlo frontend for MALA. With this libary it will be possible to perform
Monte-Carlo calculations using MALA models to evaluate total energies. MCMALA
will handle things like parallelization and interfacing to MALA. 

# Installation
TODO

# Usage
For simple tests an Ising model was implemented, based on a  [`Julia module
developed by me`](https://github.com/RandomDefaultUser/IsingModel_Julia). 
The same constraints as for this code apply here.
